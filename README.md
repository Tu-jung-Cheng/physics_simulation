## Coding for Simple Physics Simulation

Combining programming and physics, students are allowed to make three-dimensional dynamic simulations that follow the laws of physics and have quantitative results.
Learn programming language by simulating more advanced physical phenomena in general physics (mechanics, waves, heat) in the first semester of freshman year.
Thematic production: through special projects, practice the ability to build complex models from scratch
